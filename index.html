					<li class="year">1859-Nikola Tesla is born</li>
					<li class="event">
						Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan,
						within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day
						Croatia), on 10 July 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879),
						was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1870-Tesla's Brush With Death</li>
					<li class="event">
						Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high
						school. Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after
						his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close to
						one year, and he faced near-death circumstances.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1875-Tesla Enrolls In College</li>
					<li class="event">
						Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military scholarship. He
						was a disciplined student and achieved the highest grades possible
						while passing various exams. More so, he also started a cultural
						club and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the
						Technical Department. During his second year, he got into an
						argument with one his professors over the functionality of the
						Gramme dynamo.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1880-Tesla Moves To Prague To Study Philosophy</li>
					<li class="event">
						Tesla’s uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to
						finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his
						lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify
						for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in
						Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for
						the courses.
					</li>
					<li class="year">
						1881-Tesla Begins His Career As Chief Electrical Engineer
					</li>
					<li class="event">
						he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph company.
						Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone Exchange
						company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in another
						company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in operation, and
						he was given the position of chief electrical engineer. During his
						tenure, he introduced various operation upswings which improved the
						performance of the company.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1882-Tesla Goes To Work For Edison</li>
					<li class="event">
						Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental
						Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new
						industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large
						scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions
						and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in
						the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the
						lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical
						experience in electrical engineering.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1885-Tesla Submits Some Of His First Patents</li>
					<li class="event">
						he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to help in the
						submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla to various
						businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane. They agreed to
						help finance a new light production company under Tesla Name. Tesla
						worked to acquire the patents for the company including developing
						an enhanced DC motor. His solutions gained attention from the mass
						media who sought his solutions.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1887-Tesla Re-imagines The Electric Motor</li>
					<li class="event">
						Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by
						alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in
						Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits,
						especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the
						motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating
						magnetic field to operate the motor. This innovative electric motor
						was patented in May 1988, and it comprised of a basic self-starting
						design that did not require the use of commutators. As a result,
						this reduced the occurrence of sparking the high maintenance that
						was associated with replacing mechanical brushes

						1890-Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless Power Transmission
					</li>
					<li class="event">
						Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting power by
						inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use of AC
						voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.` He tried in
						many ways to come up with a wireless lighting system that was based
						on near field and capacitative coupling. He even performed various
						public demonstrations, where he would light up Geissler tubes to
						impress his audience. Tesla also spent close to well over a decade
						trying to come up with new solutions for lighting
					</li>
					<li class="year">1891-Tesla Patents The Tesla Coil</li>
					<li class="event">
						In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of
						the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.
					</li>
					<li class="year">1943-Tesla's Death</li>
					<li class="event">
						In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He
						died alone, and his body was found by a maid who ignored a do not
						disturb sign on Tesla’s room. The assistant medical professional
						evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to
						coronary complications. A few days after the FBI ordered for the
						acquisition of his belongings, John G Trump was called in to
						evaluate his works. Trump was a well known electrical engineer who
						worked for the state, which was held in custody. Following a three
						day investigation, a Trumps report concluded that was nothing that
						would demonstrate a hazard in unfriendly circumstances.
